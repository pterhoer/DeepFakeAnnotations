# Massively Annotated DeepFake Databases

We providing 65.3 Mio demographic and non-demographic attribute annotations of 41 different attributes for five popular DeepFake
datasets, Celeb-DF, DeepFakeDetection (DFD), FaceForensics++ (FF++), DeeperForensics-1.0 (DF-1.0), and Deepfake Detection Challenge Dataset (DFDC).

## Abstract

ToDo

For more details, please take a look at the [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01030). TODO

## Database Properties



## Annotated Sample Images

Below some sample images are shown including their corresponging 47 attribute annotations.
A positive attribute label refers to 1, a negative attribute label refers to -1, and a undefined attribute annotation is marked as 0.
